# 🎮 Justanewplayer19's Space 👋

Hi! I’m a passionate student developer with a love for all things code and creativity!  
My coding adventure began at age **8** with HTML, and since then, I’ve been on a non-stop journey exploring new languages, building fun projects, and helping others in the community.

## 🚀 What do I code with?
- **Lua:** My favorite for scripting and game modding (especially for Roblox!)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** My web dev toolkit—building cool sites and interactive experiences
- **Python:** Currently learning and loving it!
- Always up for trying something new and sharing what I discover
